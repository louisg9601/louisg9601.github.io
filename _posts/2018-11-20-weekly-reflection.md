This week we only have 3 days because of thanks giving,two of which we have computer science. On monday we went over what we already learned for a review.Then we finished our screenshot projects,which i had already did. Today we are trying to get our projects onto out blog as an image. The way it is is done is a repository called images is created,and a placeholder file is created so the repositry isnt empty. then the screenshot file is uploaded as its own file.Now you should be able to link the image onto you blog post using ```![Display Name](/link/to/your/image.png)``` ,when its done it should look like this
