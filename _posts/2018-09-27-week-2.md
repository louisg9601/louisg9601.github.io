Today i finaly figured out how to make a blog post in the blog section.It would have been nice to have gotten intstructions on how to post in the blog,but i guess this works out.This week we learned about coordinates and how they work in video games.I already know about them in C#,but i don't know what coding language we're using in this class.Usually to make a coordinate to go left or down a GameObject to go on another coordinate,you change the movement to a negative number,but to go up or down,you use a positive number.
