  This week we did our Computer Science Mid terms and had the first quater's parent-teacher conference.I did well with my grades getting B's and A's except for this class because the grading system was acting wierd. The midterm was a little bit easier than i expected,i got a few questions wrong because i wear my sweater all the time incase it gets cold in the rooms and i don't want my bag to get too heavy and they have the heat on in the school full blast and the heat makes me tired. I hope i can retake it to get a better grade. Thats what we did on monday,on tuesday we looked over the questions to see what mastery skill we thought they were and what level the question was for they mastery skill. On Thursday we used our predictions to see how well we could do in each mastery skill and what level we're at,Novice,Apprentance,or Practitioner. 
  
    Today we got the guide for the test answers,we analyzed the first page and found out that proportion correct is the percent of people that got it correct. We then had to chose a question that we either liked of found difficult. I chose question 3 because it's difficult if you aren't paying attention to the question. The question asks what the 3 argument of the innermost function is,i was tired and thought that the function name was an argument,which is a problem i had before,but learned to fix. The choices were 2,40,"solid",and "blue",i chose "solid" because it looked like the third argument,the third argument was actually "blue". Next time hopefully theres more classword to study with and go over.
