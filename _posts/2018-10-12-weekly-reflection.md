This week we continued making physical versions of our flags,i started mine and finished it in time on the day it was due(thanks for giving me the materials on the first day guys),then we learned how to make shapes in racket and the different kinds of shapes it can make. The format for it looks like this (shape radius,width, or side. ex:legnth. "mode" "color"). The next day we did pair programing which i hate just becuase of the seating arangements,if the keyboard and mouse are on the left side,why would you even consider putting the driver on the right?That day we learned how to make layers in racket using 2D shapes.Today we had to give feedback on other people's blogs. Then we were allowed to work on our blogs to get a headstart and learned the new criteria for our blogs,This week went pretty smoothly,in all my classes too,racket was a little confusing at first,but i eventually got used to it,it's definitley different from unity and visual studio,where visual studio was only the code,and the rest had to be taken care of in unity,like images,sprite animations,the speed for things,and the physics apllied to everything,including coillision.
