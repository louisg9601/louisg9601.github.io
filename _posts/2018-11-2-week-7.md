  This week we learned about contracts,bitmap/url,and breaking down functions to understand them better and how to order what part of a function into three different catagories:numbers,strings,and images. Numbers are obvioulsy any numbers that are in the function,strings are anything that is surrounded bey quotation marks,even numbers,images are anything that can be displayed,like images from google or shapes that can be made.Using bitmap/url you can pull images from seach engines,but it has to be in gif,png,or Jpeg format or else it wont dispay said image,contracts are the functions broken down into a specicific format where what is going on is usually more visable,the format looks like this: function name: numbers or strings -> image or string. What i learned this week was basically what everyone learned from the lessons. I attepmted to try and learn how to add images and backgrounds to my blog but diddn't have enough time to do so.
