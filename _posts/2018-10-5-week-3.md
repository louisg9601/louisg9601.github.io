This week we learned about color pallets and how to use them to customize our bogs,as you can see,i used green and purple for the two type of text,regular and links. We then learned more about Html files and learned about Html tags like h1 and /h1,which stand for the first heading of the page,the one  with the slash in it closes the text in the heading while the one without it opens it. On thursday we leanred about circles of evaluation and how they worked as the function and values in racket,The function of the equation goes on top and the equation goes on the bottom,sometimes theres circles inside the circles,this smaller circle stands for the parenthises around the equation that's inside the smaller button,the equation is read left to right so a nubmer on the left of the circle comes before the right,the same applies to the equations,when dividing however,it translates left to right to top to bottom.Today we started the flag project in which the objective is the create a flag in racket using code,today however,we had to start making physical versions of our flags.
