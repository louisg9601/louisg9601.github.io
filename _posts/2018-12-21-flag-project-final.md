## Flag of _Puerto Rico_ by _Louis Gonzalez_

## Describe your program
I did the Flag of Puerto Rico because that is where both sides of my family are from and feels like a part of me, I'll probably get a practitioner because of the flag I chose,i don't know what I'm going to get though because i never got the paper that shows what flags qualify for what grades.



## Current output

![Puerto Rico Flag](/images/LG_flagV2.png)

## Describe your process.

I didn't really need any help with this project, I got a time boost when I did a one on one to see what was wrong with my blog,i fixed my blog and that what was bringing my grade down so I had the rest of the period to work on my flag and define all of my functions.


## Explain your code.

-   Choose a significant part of your program (15 lines max) and paste it below. Do not insert your entire program here. _then delete this instruction_
-   Explain each argument in the code section. _then delete this instruction_
-   Tell us how it functions independently and within the whole program _then delete this instruction_

```
(define TRIANGLE/STAR-POSITION 60)
(define TRIANGLE-X 86)
(define TRIANGLE-Y SIZE)
(define STAR-X 60)
(define STAR-Y 102)
(define POSITION3 (14)
(define FLAG (put-image (star STAR-SIZE "solid" "white") 
                        STAR-X STAR-Y 
                        (put-image (rotate TRIANGLE-ROTATION(triangle LEGNTH/position1 "solid" "blue")
                                           ) 
                                   TRIANGLE-X TRIANGLE-Y 
                                   (put-image (rectangle WIDTH LEGNTH3 "solid" "white") 
                                             LEGNTH/position2 TRIANGLE/STAR-POSITION 
                                             (put-image (rectangle WIDTH LEGNTH3 "solid" "white")  LEGNTH/position2 POSITION3 (rectangle WIDTH LEGNTH/position1 "solid" "red"))))))
```

* * *

-   Explain the code you posted by telling us about each argument.
-   Then tell us how your code section fits into the whole.
