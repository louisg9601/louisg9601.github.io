## Flag of _Puerto Rico_ by _Louis Gonzalez_

## Describe your program
I did the Flag of Puerto Rico because that is where both sides of my family are from and feels like a part of me, I'll probably get a practitioner because of the flag I chose,i don't know what I'm going to get though because i never got the paper that shows what flags qualify for what grades.



## Current output

![my flag](/images/LG_FlagV2.png)

## Describe your process.

I didn't really need any help with this project, I got a time boost when I did a one on one to see what was wrong with my blog,i fixed my blog and that what was bringing my grade down so I had the rest of the period to work on my flag and define all of my functions.


## Explain your code.

This is the my entire code and some of the definitions i made for said functions,
