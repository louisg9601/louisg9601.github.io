#part 1 - My flag
  The flag that I did was the flag of Puerto Rico because that is where both sides of my family is from. The flag is 2 by 3 but I made mine 4cm by 6cm.The flag turned out extremely small,it was the smallest at my table.The flag is similar to the flag of the U.S.,both having red and white stripes with a blue shape with a star(s) in the middle. The Puerto flag stays different though,Having only two red and five white lines,with a triangle at the left end,with a single star in the middle,representing the island,Originaly,the triangle was a sky blue,but changed to a dark blue,most likely after it became U.S. territory.

#part 2 - Questions and challenges
  I didn't really have any questions during this collage project,what I did have though,we're many challenges. The first challenge I had was the scalng. The website I used for the scaling had the measurments as 40 by 10,which was too big,I used an index card for the white stripes and as the first layer for the flag and scaled it to 4in by 1in which was fiarly big. This was on the first day,the second day i made a new flag after finging a new website,making it the scale at the begining so it wasn't too small. The next challenge was finding the right colors. This was solved easily as there was enough regular red at the table for me and I coincidentaly found sky blue paper at my table for the triangle. The final challenge was making the star,I tired my best to do the star correctly but the bottom half was to big,eventually i got it to the best it could be.
