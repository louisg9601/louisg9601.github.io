This week we ony had 2 days because of the over night trip,during these two days we continued to work on put image and how to make layers with several shapes. I learned a litte  bit about the further shapes from my peers. For the third shape you need to rotate the rectange so it fits over a right triange,both of which were new to us,I firgured out that the rectangle's color wad magenta insteadd of regular purple. The final shape was a 10 pointed star,i though at first it was a star layers over another,but really,it was a radial star,the difference is  that the points on the radial star are longer than a regular star's.
